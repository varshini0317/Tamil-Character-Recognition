Tamil character recognition

A system for recognizing Tamil Handwritten characters in real time.


Convolutional Neual Network (CNN) is trained to recognize Tamil handwritten characters. 
Then, the trained model is used with an interface to recognize characters in real time.


The dataset is obtained from HP Labs India collected from native Tamil writers. 
There are about 156 characters with each character consisting of approximately 500 samples making the dataset about 82929 images in total. The dataset is available at [HP Website](http://shiftleft.com/mirrors/www.hpl.hp.com/india/research/penhw-resources/hpl-tamil-iso-char-offline-1.0.tar.gz) or at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mHnU1H_dgHokMYbatoMJH2H9W4j1cP8k/view?usp=sharing).
